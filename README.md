# Presentation

This is my contribution [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) community.
[I'm a geek](http://linkedin.com/in/brnsantanna/) born in Brazil and living in The Netherlands, work coding for automated container terminals in naval logistics industry.
In my latest projects I frequently used some images and decided to host them in [central docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/u/bsantanna/) for convenience but also for a sense of being part of something huge which is this open-source code community, which I'm proud of.
This repository is the result of several hours of (out-of-office / hobby project / coding just for fun). 
 

# Introduction

I'm an early adopter of [Docker](https://www.docker.com), seeking more in-depth and practical use I decided to read an excellent book: [The Docker Book](https://dockerbook.com), lots of examples are directly borrowed from it and adapted to my personal needs.
The images are categorized by their general purpose.
