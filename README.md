## About this project

This project is a set of container images in Docker format published on my personal account at 
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bsantanna). These images are used mostly for my own research in the following 
topics:
 
 * Agile / Lean Software Dev 
 * DevOps practices
 * Data science
 * Kubernetes
 * Enterprise Linux
 * Cloud Computing
 * Internet-of-Things (IoT) => Raspberry Pi
 * Finances
 
This effort started back in 2014 when I started using [Docker](https://www.docker.com), at some point in time 
the production of the images had to be automated, the efforts converged into a combination of Jenkins Pipelines and 
RedHat OpenShift ([OKD](https://www.okd.io/) v3.11) [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Platform used to execute CI
Tasks.

Most of the images are compatible with Raspberry Pi 3 ARM architecture.
