## About this project

This project is an automated pipeline leveraged over RedHat OpenShit ([OKD](https://www.okd.io/) v3.11) as 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) platform.

Result of pipeline is a set of multiple platform container images in Docker format published on 
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bsantanna). These images are used mostly for my own research in the following 
topics:
 
 * Agile / Lean Software Dev 
 * DevOps practices
 * Data science
 * Kubernetes
 * Enterprise Linux
 * Cloud Computing
 * Internet-of-Things (IoT)
 * Finances
 
This effort started back in 2014 when I started using [Docker](https://www.docker.com), at some point in time 
the production of these binary artifacts had to be automated and using Jenkins Pipelines with Openshift 
was a perfect match for the commodity hardware I had at hand.
