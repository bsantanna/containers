# Introduction

Welcome to bsantanna/containers repository!
Here you'll find several different [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) that I build during the last few years.

## This project

This project is a collection of base-images used in [apps development with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/develop/), classified by similarity and/or purpose.
A [Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) daily builds all images and uploads them to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bsantanna/).
Several images were designed with [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) as goal and support computers with [ARM architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) (such as [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)).

## Author

This is my contribution [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) community.
[I'm a geek](http://linkedin.com/in/brnsantanna/) born in Brazil and living in The Netherlands, work coding for automated container terminals in naval logistics industry.
In my latest personal projects I frequently built some images and decided to host them in [central docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/u/bsantanna/) for convenience but also for a sense of being part of something huge which is this open-source code community, which I'm proud of.
I'm an early adopter of [Docker](https://www.docker.com), seeking more in-depth and practical use I decided to read an excellent book: [The Docker Book](https://dockerbook.com), lots of examples are directly borrowed from it and adapted to allow practical study and/or implementation of software projects.  
This repository was built after countless hours of (out-of-office / hobby project / coding for fun).
