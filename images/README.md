# Categories

A [category](images/) in this context is a general end-goal for a set of images. Categories are divided in the following directories:

 - **[base](images/base/)**    : source-images from which all other images are based on (currently [ubuntu:xenial](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)).
 - **[clients](images/clients)** : client software which connects to some server.
 - **[daemon](images/daemon)**  : service oriented software which performs some work or serves some content.
 - **[dev](images/dev)**     : base-images used for general software development.
 - **[devops](images/devops)**  : base-images used for devops purposes.
