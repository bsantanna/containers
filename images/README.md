## Docker image categories

A category in this context is a general end-goal for a set of images. Categories are divided in the following directories:

 - **[base](base/)**    : source-images from which all other images are based on (currently and most likely in long term: [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)).
 - **[clients](clients/)** : client software which connects to some server.
 - **[daemon](daemon/)**  : service oriented software which performs some work or serves some content.
 - **[dev](dev/)**     : base-images used for general software development.
 - **[devops](devops/)**  : base-images used for devops purposes.
